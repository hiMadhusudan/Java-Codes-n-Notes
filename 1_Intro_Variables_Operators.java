/*
 *  //Java Features:
 *      -Simple and easy to learn
 *      -Secure bcz of Java Execution Environment
 *      -Portable: Bytecodes executed using JVM on mac, linux, windows
 *
 *  //Java Program Compilation:
 *      java file -> compile using javac -> class file(bytecode)
 * 
 *  //Java Program Execution:
 *      classloader loads class file -> bytecode verifier verifies bytecode and restrict illegal access to other parts of the system -> interpreter reads bytecode instruction and execute them line by line
